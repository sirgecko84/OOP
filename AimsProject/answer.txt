Question 1: What happens if the Aims class is not updated to handle exceptions when the play()
method is called?

If the Aims class doesn't handle exceptions in the play() method, uncaught exceptions can crash the program, cause instability, and lead to a poor user experience. 
Debugging issues may also become harder.
